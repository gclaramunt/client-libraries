<h3>What is Precog?</h3>
    <p>
        Precog is a schemaless, columnar database designed for storing and analyzing semi-structured, measured data.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Schemaless. </strong>Precog does not require that users create schemas. Precog identifies data that has identical schema and only stores that schema once, to maximize performance.    
    </p>
     <p>
     <strong>Columnar.</strong> Precog stores data in a column-major format that ensures all data from the same column is stored together. For typical analytical queries that only involve one or a few columns, this results in a dramatic reduction in IO, which improves performance.
     </p>    
     <p>
     <strong>Storing.</strong> Precog can import data from other sources, but it is designed to work as the primary authority for measured data. Your existing database will continue to store entity-oriented data, such as people, places, and things.
     </p>
     <p>
     <strong>Analyzing.</strong> Precog supports the data analysis language called Quirrel, which provides a simple way to perform in-database analytics, statistics, and machine learning on measured data.
     </p>
     <p>
     <strong>Semi-structured.</strong> Precog can store any kind of semi-structured data, ranging from lines in a log file, to heavily nested data structures containing objects, arrays, and primitives.
     </p>
     <p>
     <strong>Measured Data. </strong>Precog is designed for storing measured data, such as events (users clicking, engaging, and buying), sensor data, activity stream data, facts, and other kinds of data that do not need to be mutably updated.
     </p>
    <p>
   Precog was designed for the cloud, so all of Precog’s functionality is exposed by REST APIs, which are documented in our Developer Center. Client libraries are available in JavaScript, Python, PHP, Ruby, Java, C#, and other common programming languages.
    </p>
<h3>Does Precog have tables?</h3>
    <p>
    Tables help developers organize data that has similar schema (collections serve a similar purpose in many NoSQL databases). Precog does not support tables, but supports a more flexible organizational mechanism modeled after file systems.
    </p>
    <p>
    When you store data in Precog, you need to choose a location in the file system to store the data. If you choose a location that does not exist yet, it will be created automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
    The file system supports any number of levels, so you can organize your data in ways that are far more flexible and fine-grained than tabular organization.
    </p>
<h3>Does Precog support security?</h3>
    <p>
    Most databases have no meaningful security model. Precog, because it’s designed to be used by web, mobile, and server applications, has a very robust security model built-in.
     </p>
     <p>
    The security model revolves around the file system, and lets you give very fine-grained permissions to different API keys. Precog uses the same security model to provision customer accounts, and you can use the security model to provision your own customers or users (who could do further provisioning).
     </p>
<h3>What kind of data does Precog support?</h3>
     <p>
    The Precog data model is a strict superset of the JSON data model. Any valid JSON can be stored unmodified in Precog.
     </p>
     <p>
    JSON can be nested to any depth. For example, instead of having table containing customers and a table containing addresses, you can store all a customer’s addresses inside a single object:
     </p>
<pre>{

 “customerId”: “12312321”,

 “addresses”: [{“address”: “221 B Baker Street”}, {“P Sherman 42, Wallaby Way”}]

}</pre>
     <p>
    Because Precog lets you store data in denormalized form, you can often avoid doing costly run-time joins, which do not scale well as your data volume increases.
      </p>
     <p>
<h3>Does Precog support schemas?</h3>
     </p>
    Precog doesn’t require you to specify schemas upfront. However, Precog will detect duplicated schemas and only store the schema once, to increase runtime performance.
     <p>
    Unlike relational databases with strict schemas and strong normalization requirements, Precog makes it easy to store denormalized data or dirty data, and refine the structure and content of your data over time.
    </p>
<h3>What language is Precog written in?</h3>
     <p>
    Precog is implemented in Scala. Scala is a high-performance, functional / object-oriented hybrid language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine. Scala is used to create high-performing, distributed software by Twitter, FourSquare, LinkedIn, and many other companies.
    </p>
<h3>What languages can I use to work with Precog?</h3>
     <p>
    Precog supports a growing collection of client libraries. If you use a language that doesn’t have a client library, just let us know and we’ll add it for you!
    </p>
<h3>Does Precog support SQL?</h3>
     <p>
    No. SQL is an excellent language for storing, retrieving, and aggregating entity-oriented data, but most kinds of data science are not possible using SQL. Precog supports Quirrel, a highly expressive data analysis language that makes it easy to do in-database analytics, statistics, and machine learning across any kind of measured data.
    </p>
<h3>Does Precog replace my existing database?</h3>
     <p>
    No. Precog works alongside your existing entity-oriented database to store all the measured data generated from your application. Measured data includes event-oriented data (like clicks, transactions, and other user actions), as well as sensor data, activity stream data, and anything you would otherwise store in a relational fact table.
    </p>
     <p>
    Measured data is immutable. Therefore, Precog doesn’t have the ability to update or delete a single record. If you need the ability to mutably update and delete individual records, you are probably storing entities (person, places, or things) and would be better served by an entity-oriented database.
     </p>
     <p>
    Although you can store measured data in your existing database, you won’t be able to perform deep analysis and you will eventually encounter performance problems as your data grows. Precog is built to store never-ending streams of measured data, and can perform in-database analytics, statistics and machine learning.
    </p>
<h3>What are typical uses for Precog?</h3>
     <p>
    Precog is a flexible platform that provides a rapid way to solve many problems in embeddable reporting, data science and data productization. In general, if you want to store and analyze measured data, then Precog is a good fit and will outperform other technologies in this role.
    </p>
<h3>Does Precog support transactions?</h3>
     <p>
    Since Precog is designed to support immutable measured data, it does not support transactions in the classic relational sense. However, Precog does support the reliable storage (with acknowledgement) of measured data.
    </p>
<h3>Are writes written to disk immediately, or lazily?</h3>
     <p>
    Precog immediately writes data to a transaction log, which is used to build out the main data structures that Precog uses to store data. If data is sent to Precog with acknowledgement turned on, then the request will not return until after the data has been committed to the transaction log, at which point the data can be considered secure and will eventually be available for querying.
    </p>
     <p>
    Precog is an eventually consistent data store, so that writes may not immediately be reflected in reads (although in practice, the delay is usually quite small).
    </p>
<h3>Where is Precog hosted?</h3>
     <p>
    Precog’s cloud offering is hosted in a variety of data centers to maximize availability and performance.
    </p>
<h3>Is Precog built on Hadoop, Cassandra or something else?</h3>
     <p>
    Precog is original technology highly-optimized for storing and analyzing measured data. It is not built on any other database technology.
    </p>
<h3>How does Precog differ from NoSQL databases?</h3>
     <p>
    NoSQL databases are designed to store entities, such as people, places, and things. Precog is designed to store measured data, like events that describe what users are doing, events that describe what a system is doing, or the results of a survey or poll.
    </p>
     <p>
    NoSQL databases make it easy to store and retrieve entity-oriented data. Precog makes it easy to store, retrieve, and deeply analyze measured data. Many use cases that are hard or impossible with NoSQL databases are very straightforward using Precog.
    </p>
<h3>How does Precog Differ from Hadoop / Cassandra?</h3>
     <p>
    Hadoop is a distributed file system, which makes it easy to store any kind of data. Hadoop is often used to store measured data, but Hadoop only provides low-level, batch-oriented ways of analyzing data. Precog is much more than a file system, is a high-level data science platform that lets you do in-database analytics, statistics, and machine learning.
    </p>
<h3>What makes Precog different than other databases?</h3>
     <p>
    Other databases aren’t designed to store and analyze measured data. Precog is designed specifically for this kind of data, and provides not just a simple way to capture and store never-ending streams of measured data, but an extremely powerful way to analyze this data. Quirrel, the query language supported natively by Precog, makes it easy to do in-database analytics, statistics, and machine learning, without having to write code.
    </p>
<h3>Does Precog support other databases?</h3>
     <p>
    Yes. Precog is designed to work well with your existing entity-oriented database. Precog can import data from NoSQL databases and relational databases.
    </p>
<h3>What are the current limits of the beta version of Precog?</h3>
     <p>
    For maximum performance, the beta is limited to the following:
     </p>
     <ul>
        <li>
            Less than a terabyte of data.
        </li>
        <li>
            250 or fewer values per record.
        </li>
        <li>
            Only top-level inequalities.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    These limitations will be lifted when Precog emerges from beta.
     </p>
<h3>Does Precog provide an on-premise solution?</h3>
     <p>
    Precog is still in beta, but please contact us if you are interested in an on-premise solution.
     </p>
<h3>How do ReportGrid and Labcoat relate to Precog?</h3>
     <p>
    ReportGrid is an HTML5 visualization engine that connects to Precog. ReportGrid can be used to interactively or programmatically build charts and reports. Many customers use ReportGrid and Precog to deploy self-service reporting inside their applications.
     </p>
     <p>
    Labcoat is an HTML5 app built on the Precog API that makes it easy to develop Quirrel queries. Labcoat has built-in help, syntax highlighting, and data management. Many developers use Labcoat to analyze data, then export the analysis as code that runs inside their applications.
     </p>
     <p>
    Both ReportGrid and Labcoat can be embedded inside your application, white-labeled, and exposed to your end-users.
