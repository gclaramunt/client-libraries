          SIGN UP: API KEYS, PATHS
        </h2>
        <p>
          Please visit the <a href="http://Precog.com/registration">Registration Page</a> to sign up for an account. When you signup, you'll get an API key and a root path. This information is accessible from your <a href="http://www.Precog.com/account">account page</a>.</p>
        <p>
          Your API key allows you to interact with the Precog API. The API key can be thought of as a combination of a username and a password. The root path is where all of your data lives inside the Precog file system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your API is initially given grants to read and write all data inside your root path. Over time, other Precog users may give you additional grants to read and write data elsewhere in the file system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your API key is tied to your Precog account. Any data you write to your root path is automatically "owned" by your Precog account. This means no one can see it unless you give them permission to see it. Precog is secure by default.
        </p>
        <h3>
          AUTHORSHIP
        </h3>
        <p>
          Accounts are used to identify authorship of data. Your accountId is the same as your root path. Whenever you use an API key to store data in Precog, the account associated with the relevant API key's write grant is marked as the author of that data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Data authorship is tracked very aggressively in Precog so that no one can see data unless the author of the data has given them permission to see it.
        </p>
        <h3>
          GRANTS
        </h3>
        <p>
          Precog currently supports the following kinds of grants:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Read</strong> - This grant lets you read any data in a path that is owned by a particular account. The read grant also implies the capabilities of the reduce grant.</li>
          <li><strong>Reduce</strong> - This grant lets you read reductions of any data in a path that is owned by a particular account (for example, counting the values or doing other operations that reduce the original data set).</li>
          <li><strong>Write</strong> - This grant lets you insert new data in a path that will be owned by a particular account.</li>
          <li><strong>Delete</strong> - This grant lets you delete any data in a path that is owned by a particular account.</li>
          <li><strong>Owner</strong> - This grant gives you "ownership" of a directory. Ownership means you can delete or move data inside the directory, even if you don't own that data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Notice how all grants except <strong>owner</strong> are tied to a specific account. No grant can confer the ability to read, write, reduce, or delete data across all accounts &mdash; that would not be secure, and Precog takes security very seriously.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have a grant, you can use that grant to create another grant which is either less powerful than the original grant, or just as powerful as the original grant.
        </p>          
        <p>
          For example, if you have a read grant to a path called /foo/, then you can use that read grant to create another read grant for /foo/bar/ (which is strictly less powerful than the original grant). Or if you have a write grant for /foo/ that does not expire, you could use that write grant to create another write grant for /foo/ that expires in two days. If you use a first grant to create a second grant, then you can revoke the second grant at any time. Additionally, if your grant is revoked, then all derived grants are revoked automatically.
        </p>
        <h3>
          ROOT PATH
        </h3>
        <p>
          When you create an account, you are assigned a unique root path. This root path will be the same as your accountId. Your API key gives you permission to read, write, and delete the data in the root path.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your root path is required by the API to access your data; it will need to be inserted in API calls or the URL to access Labcoat (an interactive development environment for analyzing data).
        </p>
        <p>
          In the documentation below, remember to replace <span class="tool-tip-path">[path]</span> with your root path and any required subpaths: rootpath/path/to/data.
        </p><a name="fs" id="fs"></a>

          FILE SYSTEM
        </h3>
        <p>
          Precog uses the metaphor of a file system to help you organize and share data. Any time you store data in Precog, you must choose a directory to store the data in. You don't have to create directories manually. Directories are created on-demand whenever you try to put data in a directory that doesn't exist yet.
        </p>
          Precog doesn't support the notion of "databases" or "tables" or "collections". Instead, you can use the file system to create however many levels of organization make sense to you. The file system forms the basis of the security model because grants are given to a specific path. So the decision of how to organize your data is not completely arbitrary (unless you have no intention of sharing access to your data). The file system and associated security model make Precog multi-tenant out of the box.<br>
          <p>
          Technically, Precog supports hierarchical multi-tenancy, which is the most sophisticated kind of multi-tenancy available. Your customers can have customers, who in turn can have customers, for any number of levels deep, each with rigorously defined and enforced permissions.
          </p>
          Some common use cases may help illustrate. An advertising company might structure its data like this:
        </p>
        <pre>
/companyname/customerID/campaignID/web/cpm
/companyname/customerID/campaignID/mobile/impressions
/companyname/customerID/campaignID/mobile/clicks
etc.
      </pre>
        <p>An e-commerce platform might structure its data like this:</p>
        <pre>
/platformname/clientcompany/transactions
/platformname/clientcompany/checkouts
/platformname/clientcompany/products
etc.
      </pre>
        <p>
          Each event stored is typically a <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> object. A JSON object is an unordered set of name/value pairs. For example:
        </p>
        <pre>
{ "age:" 36,"customerID": "0019327","status": "active" }
</pre>
        <p>
          Note that it is important that numeric values not be surrounded by quotes or they will be interpreted as strings and not as numeric values. It is generally preferable to store data as JSON objects even if the data is just a value or even an array. For example:
        </p>
        <pre>
{"age": 19}
</pre>
        <p>is preferable to:</p>
        <pre>
19
</pre>
        <p>Similiarly, storing an array in a JSON object with a field name like below:</p>
        <pre>
{"states": ["colorado","idaho","california"] }
</pre>is better than storing just the array:
        <pre>
["colorado","idaho","california"]
</pre>
